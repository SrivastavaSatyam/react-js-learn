# React + Vite

## Getting Started

Today, I learned how to set up a React application using Vite, which is a build tool that offers a faster and more efficient development experience for modern web projects.

### Steps to Create the Project

1. **Create a new Vite project:**
    ```sh
    npm create vite@latest
    ```
    I followed the prompts to provide the project name, selected React, and chose JavaScript.

2. **Remove unnecessary files:**
    I deleted any files that were not needed or that I was not familiar with at this point, such as CSS files.

3. **Clean up code:**
    I removed any unknown or unnecessary code from `App.jsx` and `main.jsx`.

### Running the Project

To start the development server, I ran:
```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

This started the Vite development server, and I was able to view my React application in the browser.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production, I ran:
```sh
npm run build
```

This created an optimized build of my application in the `dist` directory.
