# React + Vite


## Password Generator Project

In this project, I learned about different hooks in React:

- **useState**: A hook that lets you add state to functional components. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update it.
- **useCallback**: A hook that returns a memoized callback function. It is useful when you want to prevent a function from being recreated on every render, which can help with performance optimization.
- **useEffect**: A hook that lets you perform side effects in functional components. It takes a function that contains the side effect logic and an optional array of dependencies.
- **useRef**: A hook that returns a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument. It can be used to access a DOM element directly.
