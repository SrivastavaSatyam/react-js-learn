Sure! React Fiber is a complete rewrite of the React core algorithm. It is designed to enable incremental rendering of the virtual DOM, which improves the responsiveness and performance of React applications. Here is a basic explanation and some code to illustrate how React Fiber works:

## Explanation
React Fiber introduces the concept of "fibers," which are units of work that can be split into smaller chunks. This allows React to pause and resume work, making it possible to prioritize more important updates and improve the user experience.

## Key Concepts
- **Incremental Rendering**: React Fiber can break down rendering work into smaller units, allowing it to pause and resume work. This helps in keeping the UI responsive.
- **Prioritization**: React Fiber can assign different priorities to different types of updates, ensuring that more important updates (like user interactions) are handled first.
- **Concurrency**: React Fiber supports concurrent rendering, meaning it can work on multiple tasks simultaneously.

## Example Code
Here is a simple example of a React component that demonstrates how React Fiber handles updates:
